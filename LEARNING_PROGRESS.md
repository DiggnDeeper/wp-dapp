## Notes and Reflections

*We've made significant progress on the plugin by implementing secure credential storage using encryption. This ensures that users' private keys are stored securely in the WordPress database. We've also added credential verification to provide feedback to users about the validity of their credentials. The next steps include improving overall error handling and adding user documentation.*
