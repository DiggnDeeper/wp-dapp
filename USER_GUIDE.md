**Q: Can I edit a post after publishing to Hive?**  
A: Yes, you can edit your WordPress post, but you'll need to publish a new post on Hive as the blockchain doesn't allow editing.

**Q: What happens to images in my post?**  
A: Images hosted on your WordPress site are referenced by URL in the Hive post.

**Q: Can I schedule posts to Hive?**  
A: You can schedule posts in WordPress, but publishing to Hive requires manual approval through Keychain.

**Q: How many beneficiaries can I add?**  
A: You can add up to 8 beneficiaries per post on Hive.
