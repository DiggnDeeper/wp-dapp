Suggested next steps (fast wins)
* Confirm the 0.9 scope in DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md.
* Decide Pro add-on vs Managed service as the first revenue MVP.
* Add PHPCS (WP rules) + Prettier config and a simple CI smoke test.
* Dogfood on 2 sites and start capturing metrics.
* Run front-end Chrome DevTools scan on `https://dapp.diggndeeper.com` (console, network, assets). If server-side insight is needed, use Query Monitor (temp Editor with `view_query_monitor`) or enable `WP_DEBUG_LOG` and review `wp-content/debug.log`.


I created AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md, anchored and tightened BASELINE.md, refreshed DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md with a 0.9 target, updated CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, readme.txt, expanded FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md, and added docs/NUKE_AND_PAVE.md.
